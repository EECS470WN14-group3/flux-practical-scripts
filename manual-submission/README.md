Manually Submit (_Using Better Build System_)
=============================================

This is a forked version of [Joshua Smith](mailto:smjoshua@umich.edu)'s original
`synth.sh` and `pbs.sh` setup. It has been updated to utilize the new-er
[scratch space](http://cac.engin.umich.edu/resources/storage/flux-high-performance-storage-scratch)
that didn't exist (or he wasn't using?) in 2010.
