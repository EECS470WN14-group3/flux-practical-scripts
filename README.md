Flux Example Scripts
====================

A short collection of useful example scripts for working with Flux in EECS 470.

The cores of `synth.sh` and `pbs.sh` are jacked from a forked version of
[Joshua Smith](mailto:smjoshua@umich.edu)'s original setup provided in the
example [Better Build System](http://www.eecs.umich.edu/eecs/courses/eecs470/Final_proj/better_build_system.tar.gz)
download. They have been updated to utilize the new-er
[scratch space](http://cac.engin.umich.edu/resources/storage/flux-high-performance-storage-scratch)
that didn't exist (or he wasn't using?) in 2010.
